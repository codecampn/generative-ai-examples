# Inspirations and examples for your next Generative AI project

This repository contains small examples using OpenAI (and probably other provides in the future).

This repository will grow over time, in case you encounter issues with examples feel free to raise an issue.

You probably should sign up at https://openai.com/ and get an API key before you start. Other than that we try to avoid additional service accounts.

## Trying out the examples

You can either run the examples locally in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) or use a service 
like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Current examples

### ✉️ Detect a throw away mail address
> 🧪 [Try it in Google Colab!](https://colab.research.google.com/github/codecampn/generative-ai-examples/blob/main/examples/detect-throw-away-mail.ipynb)

[Jupyter notebook](./examples/detect-throw-away-mail.ipynb)

You don't want users from anonymous mail providers to register at your service. But keeping a list of all providers is tedious. Use an autonomous agent to google a users domain and figure out whether it is a disposable mail provider.
